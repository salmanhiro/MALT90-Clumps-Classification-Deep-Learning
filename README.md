# MALT90-Clumps-Classification-Deep-Learning

## Classification of Molecular Clumps and Uncertain Clumps Assignment


### 1. Dataset
We use the MALT90 Dataset (Rathborne et al., 2016), downloaded from https://data-portal.hpc.swin.edu.au/dataset/the-malt90-line-catalog/resource/

### 2. Data Cleaning
We use the Gim images, assigned into classes for model training, and preprocessed by eliminating the border and split into train, validation, and test dataset.
